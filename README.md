# Discord Werwolf Bot
This bot will be the narrator for the game werwolf in a discord server. Players will use commands from the bot to make actions in the game. A player can be on the villagers team or the werewolves team. There are options to add other teams like the vampires. Every night the werewolves attack and eat one villager. During the day the villagers vote for a plyer to be hanged. The villagers do not know who is on the villager team or the werewolf team. They will have to find out who the werewolves are and vote for them. The werewolves do know who is on their team. They try to act like a villager and survive from the vote. The werewolves win if the number of werewolves are equal or grater than the villagers plus any other teams playing (vampires). The villager will win when they killed all the werewolves and other teams (vampires). The game is in real time. The day and voting will end at 8pm and the night will end at 8am. During the day the villagers and werewolves will vote. During the night the werewolves will talk, in a private chanel, on who to target.
